The efficient frontier is the set of points $\{(\sigma_{p},\mu_{p})}$ that corresponds to the optimal portfolio, where the optimal represents the portfolio with the least amount of risk ($\sigma_{p}$) for the greatest return ($\mu_{p}$). When a portfolio comprises primarily risk assets, the relationship between risk and reward is quadratic and is typically diagrammed as the *Markowitz bullet* on the risk-return spectrum.
